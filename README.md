# Cpp-Training
A place to share my C++ training codes and exercises

## Sources Codes
- **Dice**: A source code from a program that simulates a dice on any side being rolled as many times as you like;
- **Rcs**: Customer registration system example. Adds, removes, and displays registered customers (total= 1000 custumer). It doesn't save any data, it's just an example.
